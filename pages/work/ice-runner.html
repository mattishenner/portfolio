            <h3>Concept & my roles</h3>
            <p>In this fun project we developed a fully functional game as an installation concept for Museum Kolding, to communicate how the landscape around the museum once was covered by thick sheets of ice, and inhabited by woolly mammoths. The game incorporates knowledge about the ice age as a key game mechanic by asking questions which, if answered correctly, gives the player a score multiplier.</p>
            <p>My roles in this project was animations and programming. Animations were done by importing illustrator files into after effects and are displayed here using Lottie. Code was written in GML, an object oriented language developed specifically for game development.</p>

                    <h3>So, how does it work?</h3>
                    <p>The game is an endless side scrolling runner game with a high schore system. It get's progressively harder by speeding up and spawning more obstacles. The world is randomly generated so no two runs are exactly the game. I guess you could call it a classic toilet game.</p>
