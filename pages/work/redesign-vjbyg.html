        <h3>Redesign for local contractor</h3>        
        <p>The concept of this redesign was to create strong call-to-actions and use a color scheme well known from the contracting industry to induce a sense of familiarity. It was important for us to tell a story of a multi generational and local company as a trustworthy partner for  potential customers. We focused on making a responsive website by designing with the principle of mobile first.
            <br> In this project my primary role was with ux/ui and logo design.

        <p>The frontpage contains five segments which works to build trust and answer all of the customers immediate questions. On subpages customers can find further information.</p>
        <p>We also created a completely new logo to go with their new visual identity. The idea of the logo is to immediately connect VJ-byg to the construction industry as well as appear more professional with a more modern logo.</p>

        <p>With a majority of all internet traffic coming from mobile devices, it was obviously very important for us to create a modern responsive design.</p>
