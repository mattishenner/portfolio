        <h3>Redesign for local contractor</h3>        
        <p>THE CONCEPT OF THIS REDESIGN WAS TO CREATE STRONG CALL-TO-ACTIONS AND USE A COLOR SCHEME WELL KNOWN FROM THE CONTRACTING INDUSTRY TO INDUCE A SENSE OF FAMILIARITY. IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO TELL A STORY OF A MULTI GENERATIONAL AND LOCAL COMPANY AS A TRUSTWORTHY PARTNER FOR  POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS. WE FOCUSED ON MAKING A RESPONSIVE WEBSITE BY DESIGNING WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF MOBILE FIRST.
            <br> IN THIS PROJECT MY PRIMARY ROLE WAS WITH UX/UI AND LOGO DESIGN.

        <p>The frontpage contains five segments which works to build trust and answer all of the customers immediate questions. On subpages customers can find further information.</p>

        <p>We also created a completely new logo to go with their new visual identity. The idea of the logo is to immediately connect VJ-byg to the construction industry as well as appear more professional with a more modern logo.</p>

        <p>With a majority of all internet traffic coming from mobile devices, it was obviously very important for us to create a modern responsive design.</p>
